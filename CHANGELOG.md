## v1.2.1 - 2026-08-13

- Fix: force-refresh static compare images (old HID / new LED) and ensure served files match uploaded originals.
- Feature: add compare images to project detail page with vertical layout and captions (old hid lighting above, new led lighting below).
- Style: centered, bold image captions; constrained image max-height; adjusted layout to keep `Project Results` full-width.
- Admin: improved translations textarea layout and widths in Django admin (`TranslationsWidget` + `admin_overrides.css`).
- UX: moved `Download PDF` button to page bottom and adjusted alignment.
- Ops: updated staticfiles via `collectstatic` and removed stale cached copies to ensure browser sees updated assets.

### Notes
